        >The Suzuki GSX-R1000 is a supersport motorcycle made by Suzuki.[1] It
        was introduced in 2001 to replace the GSX-R1100 and is powered by a
        liquid-cooled 999 cc (61.0 cu in) inline four-cylinder, four-stroke
        engine although originally 988 cc (60.3 cu in) from 2001 to 2004.

        >For 2001, Suzuki introduced a new GSX-R model that replaced the largest
        and most powerful model of the GSX-R series sportbike, the GSX-R1100,
        with the all-new GSX-R1000. As the model name revealed, the engine's
        cylinder displacement was roughly 1,000 cc (61 cu in), about 100 cc
        smaller than its predecessor. The GSX-R1000 was not just an enlarged
        version of the GSX-R750, although it shared many features with its
        little brother. The mainframe is the same in both models, but the
        material used on the big brother was .5 mm (0.020 in) thicker. Suzuki
        claimed the torsional rigidity of the frame had increased 10% in
        comparison with the GSX-R750.

        >The GSX-R1000 engine was a redesigned GSX-R750 engine. The R1000 had a
        1 mm (0.04 in) bigger bore and 13 mm (0.51 in) longer stroke, newly
        designed pistons with lower crown, and gear-driven counter balancer. The
        engine weighed 130 lb (59 kg) which was slightly heavier than the 750
        engine but 31 lb (14 kg) lighter than the engine of the GSX1300R. The
        performance of the engine is a peak of 160 bhp (119 kW) at 9,500 rpm, as
        measured on the crank and 143 hp (107 kW),[2] when measured on the rear
        wheel with small variations between different instances of the same
        model.</i
